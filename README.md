# case-study-on-laptop-dataset

**Project Title: Case Study on Laptop Dataset**

**Project Description:**
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive case study on a laptop dataset. The initial phase involved data cleaning using SQL to address data quality issues. Subsequently, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract valuable insights and patterns from the dataset, highlighting my data preprocessing and analysis skills.

**Key Achievements:**
- Successfully cleaned and transformed the initially messy dataset using SQL, ensuring data quality and reliability.
- Conducted in-depth EDA to unveil meaningful trends and patterns within the laptop dataset, showcasing data analysis proficiency.
- Contributed to data-driven decision-making by providing actionable insights and recommendations based on the EDA results.

**Technologies Used:**
- Data Cleaning: SQL
- Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Impact:**
The "Case Study on Laptop Dataset" project demonstrated my ability to turn raw and unstructured data into a valuable resource for decision-making. Through data cleaning and EDA, I provided a solid foundation for future data-driven endeavors and showcased my commitment to enhancing data quality and extracting meaningful insights.
